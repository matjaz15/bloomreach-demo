# BloomreachDemo

Description:
Keep the following in mind:
● Use angular CLI to solve the assignment.
● Fetch the events and their attributes for the filter from this endpoint: https://br-fe-assignment.github.io/customer-events/events.json
● Focus on good component structure with reusability and clear data flow in mind.
● Try to work iteratively towards a functional solution which does not need to be feature complete.
● A pixel perfect solution is not mandatory.
● Log the data model into the console when the Apply filters button is clicked. We would like to see how you structure the data.
● Send us a link to a GitHub repo with your solution

Usage of the component can be found inside of app.component.html
